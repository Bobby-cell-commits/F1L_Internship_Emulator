Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore the use of the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers?
Trastuzumab: Targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.
Bevacizumab: Targets VEGF and is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.

To break down the key scientific question into its constituent components, we need to identify and dissect the various elements involved in the question. Here's a detailed breakdown:

Components of the Key Scientific Question
Objective: Exploration of Antibody Therapies in Additional Cancers

What are we trying to explore?
The potential use of trastuzumab and bevacizumab in cancers beyond their current FDA-approved indications.
Why is this exploration important?
To potentially expand the therapeutic use of existing antibody therapies, leading to improved treatment options for other cancer types.
Data Source: scRNA-seq Data from Cancer Cell Lines

What is scRNA-seq?
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a technique that allows for the analysis of gene expression at the single-cell level.
Why use scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines?
To identify gene expression patterns and molecular characteristics that may indicate responsiveness to antibody therapies.
Antibody Therapies: Trastuzumab and Bevacizumab

Trastuzumab:
Target: HER2 (Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2)
Current Use: HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.
Potential New Targets: Other cancers with overexpression or amplification of HER2.

Bevacizumab:
Target: VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)
Current Use: A variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.
Potential New Targets: Other cancers with significant VEGF-driven angiogenesis.
